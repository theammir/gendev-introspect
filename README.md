# âœ¨ Features
* ## ðŸ¦€ Utilizes Rust's type safety
  <sub>we're going to convert these to JS Objects anyway, so, uh, speaking of which,</sub>
* ## ðŸ’  Compiled into a Node.js native addon, powered by [napi](https://napi.rs)
  Just so you can use it on actual JavaScript functions, the ones you were so cruel to convert into plain text.
* ## My code is not _that_ scary

# Usage
The library can be built with
```bash
npm i
npm run build
```
For the sake of example, the binary is moved to `js_project` folder, where `index.js` can be executed.
```bash
cd js_project
node index.js
```
